Pull requests are welcome.

## Wallets
You may add one Wallet at a time to the list, all keys **must** be filled.

## Adapters
You may contribute an adapter for any particular languages, we are currently interested in Python, Ruby, etc...
The idea is to ease the use of this map in any project, by providing a useful wrapper for a particular packaging solution.

## Image
Add a **DockerHub** image alias to the list of images available for a particular wallet.

## Data structure
The current data structure might be subject to change between major version releases.
We are open to discuss the current naming convention in favor of an even more **unopinionated** one.
Adding more informations to the existing structure is always welcomed, as long as the new key is also added to other wallets.
> The new key **may** be left empty for other wallets, but **must** exists nonetheless
